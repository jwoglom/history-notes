# Why was WWII called "The Good War"?
- "justly" fighting fascism
- depression -> prosperity
- desegregation in the military and workforce
- expanded opportunities for women and African-Americans
    - indirectly led to the civil rights movement
- US wasn't really touched at all by the war (except for Pearl Harbor)
- cool technology
- we were attacked (it's not like we attacked them first)

## The Holocaust: Why did the US not intervene sooner?
- experience of the Great Depression: they'll take jobs!
- what's actually happening to the Jewish is really beyond comprehension
    - the death toll numbers must be propaganda, they're too high!
- very subtle anti-Semitism
    - the "outsiders"
    - Jews are associated with money
- Auschwitz bombing: we didn't because
    - we didn't want to use dive-bombers (have to actually defeat Germany)
- scared about what we'd see

## The Home Front: Economy
- 1941: 1.6 million members of the armed forces
- By the end of the war, 15 million

### Industrial Production
- Automobile factories -> planes/tanks
- Merry go rounds -> gun mounts
- Pinball machines -> armor piercing shells
- Industry isn't nationalized in general

- Size and power of govt. expands far more than it did in the New Deal
- Defense spending goes from 9% -> 46% of gross national product
- 9billion federal budget -> 98billion
- 1.1mil federal employees -> 3.8mil (not including Selective Service/military)
- 1941: 6 months to build a merchant cargo ships -- 1945, a single day
- 1944: US produces twice as much as all of the Axis powers combined

### Consumers
- Demand without supply results in price increases
- the Office of Price Administration freezes prices, wages, rent
    - the market doesn't set prices anymore
    - this leads to rationing
        - propaganada: "I pay no more than top legal prices, I accept no
          rationed goods without giving up ration stamps"
- by 1944, unemployment disappears
    - decreased goods, increased purchasing power (!)
    - the war was great for big business
        - but this leads to economic concentration
        - government contracts
            - the companies that have them get bigger
            - those that don't get smaller

### Workers
- Labor unions: 9mil -> 14.8mil in 1945
- Organized labor
    - Agrees not to strike
    - But no collective bargaining to raise wages (OPA)
        - pensions, healthcare, benefits happen
        - this is why healthcare is tied to your job

### Financing the war
- we spend 250mil per day
- added up, it's several billion.

- income taxes over 90% for the highest tax bracket
- for the first time, middle and lower-income folks actually have to pay taxes

- bonds are brilliant
    - buying bonds helps stop inflation
    - the 50s/60s boom is due to this
    - propaganda to buy bonds

## Impact on Society
- Brought a middle-class standard of living to millions
- Middle class earnings double
- Earnings of the bottom 1/5th increased by 68%

### African Americans
- "Double Victory": Victory at home and abroad
    - abroad is easy
    - home: civil rights movement
- Membership of NAACP doubles
    - Brown vs Board is won

- 1.5 million left the South: second wave of great migration
- they face de-facto segregation, sometimes with riots

### Mexican Americans
- During the Great Depression, we kick them out
- During the war, we tell them to come back
- "bracero" program: we welcome them as farm workers

- of course there are racial tensions

### Native Americans
- 25,000 join the military
- 75,000 work in defense industries
- half of those who left never returned to reservations
- Navajo code-talkers
- WWII offers opportunity if you leave your culture behind

### Women
- Rosie the Riveter
- Women join the military, the workforce
- This isn't new, but...
    - They're working in heavy manufacturing jobs
    - Older, married
        - 60% are over 35 years old
        - 75% are married
        - 33% had children under 14 years old
    - This is becoming socially acceptable

- The men want their jobs back, but the women want to keep them

### Japanese
- Executive Order 9066: Japanese internment
- California people have to move inland
    - why? The fear is that the Japanese will help in an invasion
    - but they have to sell **everything** really fast
- Internment camps are not concentration camps
- Korematsu challenges this in court and makes it to the Supreme Court
