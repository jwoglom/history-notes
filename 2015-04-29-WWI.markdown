# World War I
- Why did the US enter the war on the side of the Allies?

## WWII vs WWI
- WWII has a clear "bad guy", WWI doesn't
- Unclear if US should enter the war in WWI

## Answering the Question
- Anti-German propaganda
- Economic issues: loans to Allies
- Spread democracy
- Expansion of armed forces: use it or lose it
- Historical ties to Britain
- US under attack despite neutrality

### Submarine Warfare: The Lusitania
- Attacked by a German U-Boat
    - Not just a passenger ship... but still

### British Propaganda
- Zimmerman Telegram
    - sent by Germany
    - the "last straw": intercepted by the British
    - tl;dr says Mexico gets their land back if they attack the US

## The Actual War
- Trench warfare
    - disease
    - trench foot
    - new weaponry makes it impossible to not be in trenches

## The Home Front
### Raising an Army
- Lots of recruiting propaganda
- There **is** a draft, but propaganda is better for a Democracy

### The Economy
- Propaganda to preserve resources
    - Home Garden

- The New Economy
    - Unemployment goes close to zero
    - Expansion of "big government" from the progressive era
    - Consumer production -> war production must be managed
        - No actual nationalization of industry, just close oversight
    - Expansion of opportunities for disadvantaged groups
